RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, \nwhich could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our Class A and \nClass C stock.\nRisks Specific to our Company\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. Reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new \nand existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business. \nWe generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute \nour products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners \nmay not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new \nsales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising \npolicies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the \npast, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \nmake customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated \nthese technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. Failing to provide \nsuperior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \noperating results. \nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have \naffected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on \nadvertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, \ncustomers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and \noperating results. \nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user \nneeds, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology \ndevelopments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses \nevolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant \nresources in R&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services. \nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from \nlarge and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories and well established \nrelationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, \nincluding by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in R&D and in talent, initiating intellectual property and competition \nclaims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Further, \ndiscrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without \ncommensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide \nproducts and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us. \nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs \nand desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. As new and existing technologies continue to \ndevelop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or \nbetter than ours. These technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways \nand expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors\u2019 success in providing \ncompelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could \nharm our financial condition and operating results. \nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could divert \nmanagement attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments that we \nare making across our businesses, such as in AI, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are \nuseful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments span a wide range of industries beyond"

If the quality of our \nproducts and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such \nas the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, \nand intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices \ncould result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to \nprocure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to \nlitigation or financial claims. \nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our \nability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our \ninformation technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from \nmodifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed \nconflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects \nand power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, \ncomputer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to \nharm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural \ndisasters. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential \ndisruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts \nhappening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. \nThe occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers \ncould result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have \ncontained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our \nservices or systems. Any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, \nwhich could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International \nrevenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this \nsection, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n \nz restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating \ncash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n \nz import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or \nproviding services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular \nmarket, and may increase our operating costs;\n \nz longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n \nz an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and \nchallenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate;\n \nz sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to comply with local laws, \nincluding as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine;\n \nz political unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of our products and \nservices, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and services, or may impede us from \noffering products or providing services to a particular market; \n \nz anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government \nofficials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;\n \nz uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty as a result of local laws, insufficient due \nprocess, and lack of legal precedent; and\n \nz different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, \nlanguage, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions."

This year, we continued to optimize our governance structure and management policy, as well as scaling \nup anti-corruption training in order to create a positive, healthy and fair working environment. This also included \nconstant updates to our anti-bribery and corruption policies for employees, suppliers, and other business partners. \nFor instance, we revised the Approach to Manage Violation of Business Conduct of Xiaomi Employee to provide a \nclearer classification of acts that violates business conduct, and specify the procedures to ensure accountability. In \naddition, we released a renewed version of the Business Integrity Agreement this year, which has been appended to \nour service agreements with suppliers and business partners as part of their contractual obligations.\nIn 2022, the case involving a former employee of the Company was concluded with the disposition of the offender \nbeing convicted for bribing of non-state functionaries, as stipulated in Article 163 of the Criminal Law of the PRC, and \nwas sentenced to 6-month imprisonment and a fine of RMB10,000.\nFostering Business Integrity\nThis year, we organized a series of employee training that covered the topics of anti-bribery and corruption news, \nlegal requirements and standards, case studies, whistleblowing, and conflict of interest. In March, the entire Board \nof Directors was updated on the progress of integrity management and the outcome of anti-corruption training. We \nrolled out extensive online and offline training sessions to all levels of our employees (management, frontline staff, \nfresh graduates, interns, and part-time employees), and achieved 100% employee coverage.

As of the end of this reporting period, we \nhave achieved the following:\n\u2022 \nWe have built a total of 2,628 on-site service points in mainland China, representing a 40.4% increase compared \nto 2021. Nearly 16,000 engineers holding Xiaomi professional technical qualifications are employed at these \non-site (door-to-door) service points;\n\u2022 \nThe on-site service capability has covered all urban and rural areas in mainland China.\nDelivery Services\nWe have enhanced the efficiency and quality of our delivery services by optimizing product storage planning, reducing \nproduct delivery turnover times, and increasing direct delivery. During the current year, we have achieved the \nfollowing:\n\u2022 \nIn mainland China, our same-day order fulfillment rate has reached 99.99%, resulting in 85% of orders being \ndelivered within 1 day.\nComplaint Management\nWe aim to swiftly and effectively handle user complaints promptly and efficiently mobilizing internal resources to \nrespond to user complaints. We actively transform every communication with users into positive value and ensure \nthat all types of user issues are accurately, promptly, and reasonably resolved, while continuously improving the \nuser experience process. At the same time, we use multi-channel and multi-dimensional user complaint analysis \nmanagement to conduct reverse effect verification through mechanisms such as improvement program and follow-up \nmechanisms, forming a closed-loop management of user complaints, and promoting the continuous improvement of \nthe user experience.\nOverseas Service Management\nXiaomi conducts business activities in over 100 markets.

The theft, loss or \nmisuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory \nproceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including \nfor data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states \nhave enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing \nspecific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As \napplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain \ndata processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these \nrights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter \nrequirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy \nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer \nPrivacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives \nCalifornia residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive \ndetailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation \nand the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other \nstates, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related \nto the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data \nprivacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase. \nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data \nprotection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom \nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic \nArea, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data \nis stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to \npenalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer \nprotection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI \nAct could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change \nour business practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the \nUnited States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data \ntransfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. \nThe European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validly transfer \npersonal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of \nprotection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as \nwell as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-\nbased organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to \ntransfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal \nchallenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to \nthe United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws \nand local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could \nresult in fines from regulators. For example, China\u2019s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and \ndata localization. Data broadly defined as important under China\u2019s law, including personal data, may not be transferable \noutside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance \nwith these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to \nincur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The \ninability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, \nlimit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or \nrequire us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some \nEuropean regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the \nGDPR\u2019s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such \nobligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the \nGDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We \nsometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, \nit could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy \npolicies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory \nprinciples, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking \nin transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement \nactions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\n29"

The computing \nmodel pioneered by NVIDIA has \nreached critical mass and has been \nadopted broadly as the path forward.\nAccelerated computing will modernize \nthe world\u2019s trillion-dollar data \ncenter infrastructure. Its increased \nthroughput and cost and energy \nsavings are remarkable. Two NVIDIA \nHGX computers with Hopper GPUs \nthat together cost $500K can replace \n1,000 nodes of CPU servers that cost \n$10M for AI, scientific computing, \nor data processing workloads.\nFor data centers that are budget- or \npower-limited, NVIDIA delivers an order-\nof-magnitude increase in throughput. \nFor data centers optimized for \nthroughput, NVIDIA delivers an order-of-\nmagnitude reduction in cost and power. \nAccelerated computing is the best way \nto build sustainable data centers.\nWhen the cost of a fundamental \nresource, like computing, improves by \norders of magnitude, new methods \nare invented, and new utilities are \ndiscovered. AI researchers tapped \nNVIDIA CUDA to realize deep learning, \na machine learning algorithm that is \nincredibly compute-intensive. Deep \nlearning processes mountains of data \nto find patterns and relationships \nand learn predictive features. In \n2012, AlexNet shocked the artificial \nintelligence community by winning, by \na considerable margin, the ImageNet \ncomputer vision contest. Within a \ncouple of years, every computer vision \nalgorithm used deep learning, and \nwithin five years, computer vision had \nachieved superhuman object recognition \ncapabilities. AlexNet on NVIDIA CUDA \nwas the big bang of modern AI.\nWe recognized that AlexNet was more \nthan a computer vision breakthrough. \nWe imagined deep learning would \nfundamentally revolutionize software \nand, consequently, all computing. Deep \nlearning can scale to tackle many \npreviously impossible challenges with \nnew network architecture innovations, \nmore data, and more compute.\nIn the ensuing decade, NVIDIA \nset out to advance AI. We \npursued several strategies:\nReinvent every layer of computing, \nfrom GPU architecture, e.g., Tensor \nCores, to system interconnect, \ne.g., NVLink, systems, e.g., DGX, \nsoftware, e.g., cuDNN and TensorRT, \nto networking technologies, e.g., \nSHARP in-networking processing, \nand much more. We reinvented \ncomputing from the ground up.\nTransform into a data-center-scale \ncompany by combining with Mellanox, \nthe world\u2019s leading high-performance \nnetworking company. As computing \nlarge models and training data \nscales to require millions of trillions \nmore operations, we need not just \namazing chips but AI supercomputing \nsystems. Today, NVIDIA is an expert at \nevery computing layer, from chips to \nsoftware, and across the data center \n\u2014compute to networking. We have the \nexpertise and scale to help customers \nbuild AI infrastructures anywhere.\nBecome an AI expert by building NVIDIA \nAI Research and application-specific \nAI platforms\u2014full-stack AI platforms \nfor DLSS RTX neural graphics, DRIVE \nAV self-driving cars, Isaac robotics, \nACE digital humans, NeMo LLMs, \nBioNeMo digital biology, and Clara \nmedical imaging\u2014so that we can apply \nAI firsthand to create new markets. \nAutomotive has joined gaming as a \nmulti-billion-dollar run rate business. \nHealthcare and robotics are additional \nmulti-billion-dollar opportunities. \nDear NVIDIANs  \nand Stakeholders,"

Blackwell adoption \nis already underway by every major \ncloud service provider, server maker, \nand leading AI company, including \nAmazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, \nOpenAI, Tesla, and xAI, with Blackwell-\nbased products expected to be rolled \nout by our partners later this year.\nThe numbers are incredible\u2014208 \nbillion transistors on the B200 Tensor \nCore GPU, 600,000 parts, 3,000 \npounds, two miles of NVLink cables, \n30X faster inference, 4X speedier \ntraining, and about 25X less cost of \nownership and energy consumption \nthan Hopper, and more than double \nthe bandwidth and memory of H100. \nBlackwell has six breakthrough \ntechnologies enabling AI training and \nreal-time LLM inference for models \nscaling up to 10 trillion parameters. \nThe second-generation transformer \nengine enables Blackwell to support \ndouble the compute and model sizes. \nFifth-generation NVLink delivers \ngroundbreaking 1.8TB/s bidirectional \nthroughput per GPU for seamless high-\nspeed communication among up to 576 \nGPUs for handling trillion-parameter \nLLMs. A built-in reliability, availability, \nand serviceability (RAS) engine uses \nAI-based preventative maintenance \nto run diagnostics and forecast \nreliability issues, increasing uptime and \nresiliency and reducing operational \ncosts. Advanced confidential computing \ncapabilities, including new native \ninterface encryption protocols, provide \nunprecedented levels of security without \ncompromising performance. Finally, \na dedicated decompression engine \ndelivers a leap for data processing. \nData processing is a top workload in \nthe world\u2019s data centers. Data is the \nraw material of AI, and the amount of \ndata generated is growing exponentially. \nPre- and post-processing data for AI \ncan often consume half of the total \nworkload. NVIDIA is singular in our \nability to accelerate data processing. \nNVIDIA Blackwell and NVIDIA\u2019s \nRAPIDS acceleration libraries will let \nus achieve an order-of-magnitude \nreduction in time, cost, and energy. \nThat\u2019s a mind-boggling amount \nof performance. Still, we needed \nsomething even more significant for \nthis generative industrial revolution. \nSo, we scaled it even further. The \nGB200 NVL72 combines 36 Grace \nBlackwell GB200 Superchips to act as \na single GPU in a multi-node, liquid-\ncooled, rack-scale system. Each GB200 \nconnects two NVIDIA B200 Tensor \nCore GPUs to an NVIDIA Grace CPU. \nBlackwell is a whole computing platform \nthat customers can configure into \nvarious AI infrastructures. The Blackwell \nplatform includes the new Quantum \nInfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet \nswitches, the X800 series, designed \nfor trillion-parameter-scale AI. \nIf NVIDIA GPUs are like the neurons, \nthen NVIDIA networks are like the \nsynapses. Both are vital to performance. \nThe new Spectrum X800 is the first \nhigh-performance networking platform \nto overcome Ethernet\u2019s fundamental \nshortcomings for distributed \nsupercomputing like AI. While Quantum \nX800 is best for dedicated AI factories, \nSpectrum X800 brings many of \nNVIDIA\u2019s networking technologies \nfor AI to the large Ethernet market.\nTraining a 1.8 trillion-parameter GPT \nmodel took about three to five months \nwith 25,000 NVIDIA Ampere architecture \nGPUs. With Hopper, it would take about \n8,000 GPUs and consume 15 megawatts \nover about three months. For Blackwell, \nin the same 90 days, it would need \na quarter of the GPUs and a quarter \nof the power of prior models for the \nsame task\u2014only about 4 megawatts.\nNVIDIA AI for Every \nIndustry and Enterprise\nGenerative AI will transform every \nindustry. NVIDIA has already applied \nAI to build several multi-billion-\ndollar verticals\u2014gaming, healthcare, \nautomotive, and robotics. We are \nnow bringing NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated \ncomputing and AI to the enterprise. \nEnterprises have not historically been a \nmarket for GPUs and high-performance \ncomputing. Generative AI changes that. \nCopilots, assistants, and agents will \naugment and amplify every employee \nand business process in the future, \nand enterprises will be significant \nmarkets for NVIDIA GPU computing."
